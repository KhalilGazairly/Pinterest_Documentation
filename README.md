# Objectives:

	- The Project main goal is to develop a Clone of Pinterest site

As with most other social networks, on Pinterest people can perform standard social networking functions. 

Such as following their friends, liking and commenting on other users’ boards, re-pinning content to their own boards,
sharing others’ media on Facebook and Twitter or via email, run a search, and even embedding individual pins on their website or blog.

Going into 2020, Pinterest reported having over 320 million monthly active users worldwide. 
And as of today the Pinterest demographics include over 40% male and is the third-largest social network on the internet.

Pinterest for Business:
Colorful infographics, and visual media, that promote deals, new products, and more, can produce quality sales and traffic to your web page.

Pinning pictures of employees could also help customers identify with the people who work at the company, putting a face to a name 
and providing more information potential clients or customers love to know.
